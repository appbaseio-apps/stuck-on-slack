# Stuck on
I canâ€™t possibly be the only one who hates stopping work to go into a meeting that talks about work so that I can eventually get more work done. Stuck On is a tongue-in-cheek named realtime status reporting app built using appbase.io.


One can update the status using "/on" command and team can define a channel where they want to see all the statuses of the whole team.

First install the dependencies by running following command:    
```
npm install
```

Then run the server by following command:     
```
node server.js
```
